This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada programming when iterating through arrays.  The provided code attempts to double each element of an array, but it does so incorrectly using the array values themselves as loop indices, leading to unexpected results and potential runtime exceptions. The solution shows the correct way to iterate and manipulate elements.  This error is subtle because Ada's strong type system doesn't prevent the compilation of the faulty code, yet it will produce incorrect results.
